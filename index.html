        <h1>Welcome to this Responsive Design Website Tester! (more like a sandbox)</h1>
        <p>Here I'll be trying a few things to detect the size of the page and modify components accordingly, starting with @media queries! I tried to make this website as playful as
            possible, but with media queries you can also make sure your website fits all types of devices, from phones
            to TVs.</p>
        <h3> Before going any further, I recommend using this website on a full screen computer. Once you're ready,
            please scrool down to the maximum.</h3>

            it to discover the first one...</h3>
